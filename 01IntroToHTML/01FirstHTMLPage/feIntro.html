        <p>Welcome to Earth, <b>citizen</b>! I bet you don't know anything about it! You might think you do, but you're
            wrong. Earth was once filled with Magic, and Magnificent creatures had roamed the lands, and powerfull
            spellcasters could unleash the might of gods upon you! But Time took it all from us...</p>

        <p>Well... Most of us...</p>

        <p>There are these time-travellers... They claim they can still witness these marvels of creation. We don't
            really
            believe them. Then again, most people don't believe us.</p>

        <p><b>Are you one of us?</b></p>

        <p>Or are you just aspiring to learn the truth? In that case, you might want to brace yourself, for the
            information
            you're about to receive is not for conventionally-minded.</p>

        <p>Start with the introduction or work your way through our database. Don't forget to look at the chronicle that
            features everything that has truly happened to us, inhabitants of Earth, throughout the years.</p>
